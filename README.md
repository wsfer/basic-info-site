## About

This is the Express version of a static website that I built as part of [The Odin Project]('https://www.theodinproject.com') curriculum, previously built as node only.

## Features

The project include 4 pages (home, about, contact and 404) with some dummy content, images, a CSS and a Javascript file.

<ul>
    <li>each HTML pages have it's own route;</li>
    <li>images, CSS and Javascript files are served by express static middleware.</li>
</ul>

## How to run

### Locally

Clone the repository on your machine and run the commands:

```Shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Finally access from <strong>localhost:3000</strong> on browser.

Optionally you can create a .env file to change the port on root directory

```Dotenv
PORT=5000
```
