## About

This is a very basic Node.js static website that I built as part of [The Odin Project]('https://www.theodinproject.com') curriculum.

## Features

The project include 4 pages (home, about, contact and 404) with some dummy content, images, a CSS and a Javascript file

## How to run

### Locally

Clone the repository on your machine and run the commands:

```Shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Finally access from <strong>localhost:3000</strong> on browser.

Optionally you can create a .env file to change the port on root directory

```Dotenv
PORT=5000
```
